* I got question 1 wrong because when you process data, the time it takes and the ability to process it is affected. 
However, B is correct because the number of statements does not affect how long it will take, and it will not be affected as much.

* I got question 6 wrong. It should be V, which is 86, since base 16 with hexadecimal number 56, that would be 5 times 16, getting 80. 80 + 6 is 86, so V is correct.

* I got question 14 wrong. This is a got to know, which I did not know. 2 times as many items should be identified because using 7-bit binary sequence can be 128,
which is 2 times as much as 6-bit binary sequences.

* Fault tolerance allows for things to work even if one connection fails. Using multiple protocols does not affect fault tolerance. Data can still be transmitted
if some connections fail, since the internet is fault tolerant.
