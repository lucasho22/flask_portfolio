* I got question 1 wrong because efficiency is still imited by a sequential portion. Adding a bunch will not keep increasing efficiency.

* A citizen science project requires input from individuals. Answer d does not need inputs, so it is wrong. A is correct since the infromation can be from 
around the world, and which are not from profesesionals.

* If there is 4 bits, the biggest number that can be represented is 15, so 29 can not be displayed.

* It isn't d because open-source software can be continually updated without the original developers once it becomes available to the public. Not guaranteed there
will be support.

* It isn't b because redundancy actually requires more connections, not less. If a connection fails, then data is sent to a different route, and this can be redundant.

* You can only identify a user if the are compatible, so you can not identify everyone in a certain location. However, if you connect with others, this can help
people run outside, which shows how the application can make users have health beenfits

* The question is an example of an overflow error, as it can not display the correct number. When it exceeds the max value that can be represented, it goes to
a negative number.

* It is possiblie to enter multiple cities. and for information about multiple cities to be displayed at once. Abbreviations might make it harder, and some might have 
their own abbreviations, so it could be challenging for the web site.

* I did not see the part where it said that the research group was small, so it makes sense that it would be faster for the members of the citizen science group. 
Also, there are usually a lot of people in the citizen science.

*  Cloud storage sites allow users to share files easily, which could lead to increased concerns about copyrighted materials being illegally distributed online, so
it can't be d. It can be b because cloud computing allows for files to be shared, which means that there is enhanced collaboration.

* Collaboration can actually decrease tasks required and make it eeasier. This allows for complexity and size to decrease.

* If an online encyclopedia can be edited by anyone, then it will be harder to tell if it is copyrighted, as more different ideas are put in and making it harder
to track. However, an online encyclopedia is more advantageous in which more people can contribute their own perspectives.
