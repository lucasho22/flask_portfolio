## 5.1-5.6 Notes

### 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects
* People complete tasks to incorporate new ideas and innovations. 
* Effects can be seen as harmful
* Accelerometers
* Automobile industry drove prices down.
Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection.
Quadcopter “brain”
* Multirotors
Benefits
Deliveries, finding lost people, and aerial photography are easy.
Harmful

* Wii Controller 
Benefits
Gets people active playing video games
Harmful
Broken TV’s and injuries
* Innovations can have effects that the creators did not intend. 
* Microtransactions
“Free” games/apps
Cosmetics or pay to win
May harm society.


### 5.2
* The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geography, or demographic characteristics.
* The digital divide can affect groups and individuals.
* Digital divide raises questions of equity, access, and influence.
* Digital divide affected by people

* In some countries
Computers are not common in rural areas
The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
High level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government

### 5.3 Computing Bias
* Ex: Netflix
* Explicit data: thumbs up/thumbs down, name, address, etc
* Implicit data: When you watch, what show you binge(d), style of show frequently selected
* Bias in this example: Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most - they want more subscriptions
* Main idea: Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
* Ex: Hypothetical loan company - creating software to assist loan officers. Software finds trends in successful loans
* Reject those who don’t fit their trends: age, gender, race/ethnicity
* Main idea; Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* Main idea: Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
* All software can be biased (unintentional/intentional):
* Casual vs sweaty YouTube Kids Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/TikTok WeChat/KakaoTalk Google Home/Amazon Echo
* Questions to ask about bias:
* Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
* Intentionally harmful/hateful?
* Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

### 5.4 Crowdsourcing
* Public data sets
* Kaggle
* Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning, and more
* Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props
* Notebooks - code, data, notes
* Google public datasets
* Free for the 1st terabyte
* All-in-one package that uses BigQuery - Library and toolset that for SQL
* Data.gov
* US government data
* Agriculture, energy, water, health
* Your local government
* Keeps them accountable
* Help find solutions and trends in your area
* Main idea: widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
* Distributed computing
* Donate spare computing power to help calculations
* Folding@Home - Stanford University
* Protein folding
* BOINC - University of California, Berkeley
* A variety of projects: mathematics, astrophysics, climate, Minecraft@Home
* Main Ideas:
* Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
* Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing
* Spotify Collaborative playlists Algorithm Metadata write-in
* Crowdfunding Kickstarter IndieGoGo
* Blockchain Cryptocurrency Other tokens - concert tickets
* Main Ideas:
* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
* Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.

### 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
Intellectual Property: (IP)
* A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights.
* Because of digital devices, the sharing and ownership of IP’s has raised concerns about whether someone can access someone else’s creations.
* Copyright protects an IP; when you create anything, you automatically own an all rights reserved copyright to whatever was created.
* Copyright protects IP and keeps anyone from using it unless given expressed permission.
* When someone takes material created by someone else and presents it as their own, it’s considered plagiarism and might have legal consequences.
* Creative Commons provides free licenses to tell people how to use one’s creations.

### 5.6 Safe Computing
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Information specific to an individual.
* Examples include: 
* Social Security Number, Age , Race, Phone Number, Date of Birth, Email Addres, Mailing Address, Medical Information, Credit Card information.
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Can be used by people to steal identity.
* Although PII can be used to enhance a user’s online experience, it can also be exploited without protections and privacy.
* Information placed online is hard to delete.



### 5.1 Actions
1. 
* Communication is easier. ALl you need to do is type something and send it, instead of having to travel somewhere to send a message. However, it is harmful because peole become very reliaible on computers and technology, and are less likely to talk in real life.
* Beneficial effect of computing is Google translate. This allows people to interact with other languages and translate from one language to another. This can help in travelling. However, harmful effects is that the translation is not always accurate and it can say something that you didn't mean to say.
* Innovations can be made online, such as oline ordering, which can save gas. However, this can be harmful because it can cause people to become lazy.

2. Dopamine is a real thing. This can be seen in addiction. People can become addicted to things, like social media. People can feel good about social media, which can cause them to keep using them since it makes them feel good. Doapmine can also be good, since it can cause you to be motivated to do things. For example, I have felt doapmine when I fix a problem in coding. This causes me to want to learn more and be enegaged in it.

### 5.2 Actions
1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by taking over all the resources in the digital world, making it harder for others to access. Someone might be more educated and can use their intelligence to do a lot of thinigs, which others might not know how to do.
2. Someone who is empowered can help those who are not empowered by making things that help them. They can create things that make the digital divide smaller. In Del Norte, I can use my knowledge of coding to help people make websites. I can also make a club that helps people who don't have the same access to websites, technology, or information, as others do.
3. Paper or red tape blocking is not digital empowerment. Such barriers exist at del norte. It is easier for one to do well in computer science class with a high end computer while someone who doesn’t have a laptop will struggle. These kinds of barriers exist everywhere in the world; it is difficult to get a job in the tech industry without having been exposed to computers and have years of experience with them.

### 5.3 Actions
* After watching the video, "HP Computers are Racist," I feel like the owner of the computer didn't mean for it to move with the white lady and not move with the black man. He probably did not intend for that to happen. Maybe the computer couldn't pick up the black guy because it couldn't recognize him. He was probably too difficult to recognize and it probably thought he wasn't their. The bias was probably the lighting. It could pick up lighter things. This is harmful because it is excluding certain people from being able to use the camera mover. The bias is harming people. Because it is excluding certain people, it should be excluded.  What I would do to produce a better outcome is to make a camera that has a better way of seeing things so everyone can use the camera. 

### 5.4 Actions
* There are 150 computer science students. I could make a survey about how they feel about the class, which every student could take, and then get the results. By doing this, it is crowdsourcing because I can then use the results to then make a page that updates when information is added. Other people can then look at the page to see what people think and how people rate the class. I could also use a vegetable versus non vegetable diet. This could see how many people eat vegetables or not, and it can update yearly based on what people put. 
* Del Norte crowdsourcing could be good, since I can get reliable feedback from kids in the school. I could use their information on relevant stuff in school, or anything that could help in a final project.

### 5.5 Actions
*  Creative Commons - Good for a project where you do not mind anyone using it any way they want.
* Open Source MIT - Good for a project where you can use code freely and distribute closed versions. It also happens to be simpler and easier to digest than many common licenses
* Open Source GPL - Good for project where people can use your code but they cannot distribute closed versions.

* Our group chose an MIT license because we thought it would be the easiest to do. Also, there is not much reason for anybody to distribute the poway CTE website and its code. Additionally, the only conditions to it are that we must disclose the license and copyright information when we distribute the website.

### 5.6 Actions
* I have seen PII in previous computer science projects, such as my own project. For example, my about me page has a picture of myself with a description of who I am. Also, the GitHub ReadMe has information abou owners.
* I feel like PII is a good thing and a bad thing. It is good since it can have your information out there, allowing people to reach out to you, such as friends, colleges, or teams. This could help you. However, some might use PII as a bad thing and can find out a lot about you, and that could hurt your privacy. 
* Good passwords are those that are long and have a lot of different characters. This can make it harder to hack or guess. Bad passwords are those that are short and are very common, such as "password." Something used to help in authentication is multifactor authentication, like a list of questions that only you know the answers to.
* Symmetric encryption uses one key that all of the specified users have that can be used to decrypt a message. Asymmetric encryption involves encryption using a public key and decryption using a unique private key, which are connected mathematically.
* In deployment, we used HTTPS to encrypt our website. This uses a TLS protocol to send HTTP data/files to the user that is encrypted data.
* One phishing scheme I learned the hard way was when I saw an ad for getting more robux for a game called Roblox. I got so happy, that I quickly put in all my information, and waited for my account to have a bunch of robux in it. However, I never got my robux. It was at that moment that I realized it wasn't real and that I wouldn't be getting any robux.
