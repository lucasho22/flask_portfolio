## 5.1-5.6 Notes

### 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects
* People complete tasks to incorporate new ideas and innovations. 
* Effects can be seen as harmful
* Accelerometers
* Automobile industry drove prices down.
Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection.
Quadcopter “brain”
* Multirotors
Benefits
Deliveries, finding lost people, and aerial photography are easy.
Harmful
Flying in unregulated areas is illegal.
* Wii Controller 
Benefits
Gets people active playing video games
Harmful
Broken TV’s and injuries
* Innovations can have effects that the creators did not intend. 
* Microtransactions
“Free” games/apps
Cosmetics or pay to win
May harm society.


### 5.2
* The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geography, or demographic characteristics.
* The digital divide can affect groups and individuals.
* Digital divide raises questions of equity, access, and influence.
* Digital divide affected by people

* In some countries
Computers are not common in rural areas
The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
High level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government

5.3 Computing Bias
* Ex: Netflix
* Explicit data: thumbs up/thumbs down, name, address, etc
* Implicit data: When you watch, what show you binge(d), style of show frequently selected
* Bias in this example: Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most - they want more subscriptions
* Main idea: Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
* Ex: Hypothetical loan company - creating software to assist loan officers. Software finds trends in successful loans
* Reject those who don’t fit their trends: age, gender, race/ethnicity
* Main idea; Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* Main idea: Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
* All software can be biased (unintentional/intentional):
* Casual vs sweaty YouTube Kids Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/TikTok WeChat/KakaoTalk Google Home/Amazon Echo
* Questions to ask about bias:
* Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
* Intentionally harmful/hateful?
* Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

5.4 Crowdsourcing
* Public data sets
* Kaggle
* Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning, and more
* Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props
* Notebooks - code, data, notes
* Google public datasets
* Free for the 1st terabyte
* All-in-one package that uses BigQuery - Library and toolset that for SQL
* Data.gov
* US government data
* Agriculture, energy, water, health
* Your local government
* Keeps them accountable
* Help find solutions and trends in your area
* Main idea: widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
* Distributed computing
* Donate spare computing power to help calculations
* Folding@Home - Stanford University
* Protein folding
* BOINC - University of California, Berkeley
* A variety of projects: mathematics, astrophysics, climate, Minecraft@Home
* Main Ideas:
* Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
* Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing
* Spotify Collaborative playlists Algorithm Metadata write-in
* Crowdfunding Kickstarter IndieGoGo
* Blockchain Cryptocurrency Other tokens - concert tickets
* Main Ideas:
* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
* Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.

### 5.1 Actions
1. 
* Communication is easier. ALl you need to do is type something and send it, instead of having to travel somewhere to send a message. However, it is harmful because peole become very reliaible on computers and technology, and are less likely to talk in real life.
* Beneficial effect of computing is Google translate. This allows people to interact with other languages and translate from one language to another. This can help in travelling. However, harmful effects is that the translation is not always accurate and it can say something that you didn't mean to say.
* Innovations can be made online, such as oline ordering, which can save gas. However, this can be harmful because it can cause people to become lazy.

2. Dopamine is a real thing. This can be seen in addiction. People can become addicted to things, like social media. People can feel good about social media, which can cause them to keep using them since it makes them feel good. Doapmine can also be good, since it can cause you to be motivated to do things. For example, I have felt doapmine when I fix a problem in coding. This causes me to want to learn more and be enegaged in it.

### 5.2 Actions
1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by taking over all the resources in the digital world, making it harder for others to access. Someone might be more educated and can use their intelligence to do a lot of thinigs, which others might not know how to do.
2. Someone who is empowered can help those who are not empowered by making things that help them. They can create things that make the digital divide smaller. In Del Norte, I can use my knowledge of coding to help people make websites. I can also make a club that helps people who don't have the same access to websites, technology, or information, as others do.
3. Paper or red tape blocking is not digital empowerment. Such barriers exist at del norte. It is easier for one to do well in computer science class with a high end computer while someone who doesn’t have a laptop will struggle. These kinds of barriers exist everywhere in the world; it is difficult to get a job in the tech industry without having been exposed to computers and have years of experience with them.

### 5.3 Actions
* After watching the video, "HP Computers are Racist," I feel like the owner of the computer didn't mean for it to move with the white lady and not move with the black man. He probably did not intend for that to happen. Maybe the computer couldn't pick up the black guy because it couldn't recognize him. He was probably too difficult to recognize and it probably thought he wasn't their. The bias was probably the lighting. It could pick up lighter things. This is harmful because it is excluding certain people from being able to use the camera mover. The bias is harming people. Because it is excluding certain people, it should be excluded.  What I would do to produce a better outcome is to make a camera that has a better way of seeing things so everyone can use the camera.
