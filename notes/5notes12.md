# 5.1 Actions

1. 
* Communication is easier. ALl you need to do is type something and send it, instead of having to travel somewhere to send a message. However, it is harmful because peole become very reliaible on computers and technology, and are less likely to talk in real life.
* Beneficial effect of computing is Google translate. This allows people to interact with other languages and translate from one language to another. This can help in travelling. However, harmful effects is that the translation is not always accurate and it can say something that you didn't mean to say.
* Innovations can be made online, such as oline ordering, which can save gas. However, this can be harmful because it can cause people to become lazy.

2. Dopamine is a real thing. This can be seen in addiction. People can become addicted to things, like social media. People can feel good about social media, which can cause them to keep using them since it makes them feel good. Doapmine can also be good, since it can cause you to be motivated to do things. For example, I have felt doapmine when I fix a problem in coding. This causes me to want to learn more and be enegaged in it.

# 5.2 Actions

1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by taking over all the resources in the digital world, making it harder for others to access. Someone might be more educated and can use their intelligence to do a lot of thinigs, which others might not know how to do.
2. Someone who is empowered can help those who are not empowered by making things that help them. They can create things that make the digital divide smaller. In Del Norte, I can use my knowledge of coding to help people make websites. I can also make a club that helps people who don't have the same access to websites, technology, or information, as others do.
3. Paper or red tape blocking is not digital empowerment. Such barriers exist at del norte. It is easier for one to do well in computer science class with a high end computer while someone who doesn’t have a laptop will struggle. These kinds of barriers exist everywhere in the world; it is difficult to get a job in the tech industry without having been exposed to computers and have years of experience with them.
