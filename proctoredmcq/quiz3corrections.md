* It is not algorithm 3. Algorithm 3 gets earliest day, so it will choose someone with the earliest day of a month. This means that someone born on December 1st
could be chosen over someone on January 10th, because it goes through day. This shows how it will not correctly identify the earliest birthdays, but only the 
earliest days of the month.

* The protocols allow any computers to send data to each other. Theresfore, no extra hardware is needed to convert the packets. However, standard protocol mean that
computers can communicate directly with each other.

* String can work, but boolean is better. Boolean can show true false, adn the question is if a store is open, so true and false works the best.

* D is incorrect. It will display 0, since the list does not have Ben in it. C shows how the procedure does not work. After it searches for Ben, it should display 1,
which it does. However, it goes through each name, so it goes to Chris next. Since Chriz is not Ben, it will display 0 at the end, even though Ben is in the list.

* This algorithm will turn on the motor in some cases when the gate sensor is not activated. However, if the gate sensor is activated, then check if the gate is open.
If it isn't open, then you can turn on the motor to open the gate.

* Polynomial returns the sum of the two, not the generalization of them. n to the power of m shows the generalization because in the cube and square function, it is 
n to the power of something, so n to the power of m is the generalization.
